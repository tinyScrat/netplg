/*
    Characteristics of value object
    1. measure, quantify or describe a thing, but not a thing in itself
        A person is a thing, but name, age are attributes that describe the person

    2. Immunitable
        A value cannot be changed once created.

    3. Conceptual whole
        A value that describe money need to have amount and currency, these 2 attributes
        form a conceptual whole of monetary value

    4. Replaceablity
        Just like primitive value in a programming language, it got replaced with a new value
        that represent another value, not parts of it.

    5. Equality
        The object instance may not be the same, but as long as the attributes and the same,
        then these 2 value objects are the same.
